## Examples



## Validation
This code is mostly a 1:1 rewrite of the original TensorFlow version. I made
sure PyTorch's `grad` function works the same as TensorFlow. In theory this
code should work identically to the original version (modulo implementation
errors) or subtle difference in numerical operation of framework operations.
